    <h1>ABOUT PIZZAMANIA</h1>
    <h2> Our Story</h2>
    <p id="a">Pizza Mania isn't just a place to grab a slice – it's a culinary journey rooted in passion and tradition. Founded by two friends with a shared love for great food, our story began with a simple dream: to create the best pizza in town. From humble beginnings, we've grown into a beloved neighborhood eatery, where locals and visitors alike gather to savor the flavors of Italy right here in our own community.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p id="b">
        At Pizza Mania, we believe that quality is non-negotiable. That's why we're committed to using only the freshest, finest ingredients in every dish we serve. From our hand-tossed dough and homemade sauce to our carefully curated toppings and cheeses, we spare no expense in ensuring that each bite is a symphony of flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Community</h2>
    <p id="c">
        We're more than just a restaurant – we're a gathering place for friends, families, and food lovers of all ages. We take pride in being an integral part of our community, supporting local events, schools, and charitable organizations whenever possible. When you dine with us, you're not just enjoying a meal – you're joining a family.
